=== Q&A

[%collapsible]
====

[qanda]
Why divide workflows of GitHub Actions by events like push and pull request?::
On push event of GitHub Actions,
run-shfmt-with-reviewdog doesn't fail if there is a format violation.
It also won't fail if `fail_on_error = true`.
And run-shfmt-with-reviewdog can't reports result on push event. +
Want to job fail if there is a format violation on push,
so use sh-checker on push.
Use run-shfmt-with-reviewdog
because it's useful to report results by review comments.
As mentioned earlier,
run-shfmt-with-reviewdog doesn't reports result on push event.
Want to use run-shfmt-with-reviewdog on push and sh-checker on pull request,
so divide GitHub Actions workflows.

.Can't change `reporter` of run-shfmt-with-reviewdog
[NOTE]
======
`reporter` of run-shfmt-with-reviewdog can't be changed from `github-pr-review`.
That's run-shfmt-with-reviewdog can't set `github-check` to `reporter`.

.If there is a format violation at push, does the job fail?
[horizontal]
github-pr-review:: No
github-check:: Yes

See link:{github_url}/reviewdog/reviewdog#reporters[
reviewdog documentation^] for details.
